Details first - The annual Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) gathering was held this year at the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh. The three day unconference, Collaborations Workshop 2016 (CW16), featured timed lightning talks by attendees on their current work, demo sessions of projects, and keynote talks, with topics ranging from the Square Kilometer Array to running one man crowdsourcing projects.

The event was rounded off with the CW16 Hack Day that pitted teams of three to six attendees against each other to produce prototypes of ideas generated in the CW16 collaboration sessions.

### CW16 Hackday

So this happened - second prize at the CW16 Hackday in Edinburgh. Prior to the event I felt slightly unenthused by the idea of a hack day, after my only previous experience with this type of thing at an event in Manchester - where everyone made toilet finders and bus trackers, with not too much in the way of originality.

The make up of the crowd probably goes some way to influence the outcome of these things, and unsurprisingly the CW16 ideas were much more thought through - more machine learning than toilet tracking.

### Matchmakedemia

So what did we make? Matchmakedemia (a portmanteau of matchmaking and academia, nice work Angus) was the outcome. We pitched Matchmakedemia as an app that harvested researcher profile data from the ORCID API. 

Then using a social graph database and machine learning, researchers are matched by similar interests, or by desired skills for projects they're working on. The project, obviously just a shell of an idea at this stage, is available at the repo link in the footer.
